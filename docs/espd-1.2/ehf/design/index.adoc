= The ESPD Exchange Data Model

The ESPD Exchange Data Model (ESPD EDM) re-uses three other models, that were defined in parallel to the ESPD, the Core Criterion Data Model, the Core Evidence Data Model, and the OASIS UBL-2.1 common information components.

The figure below presents a high-level view of this data architecture for the entire ESPD-EDM. The blocks coloured in green represent libraries of components defined by the UBL-2.1 Technical Committee (TC), whilst the rest have been defined from scratch by the EU Commission (COM) ESPD development team. The blocks represented in the figure represents either a document (e.g. ESPDRequest and ESPDResponse) or a library (the rest of the blocks). Per each document or library one XSD Schema has been implemented. Each Schema has been assigned its own namespace and a specific prefix representing the namespace.
