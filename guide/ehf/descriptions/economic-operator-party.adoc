= Economic Operator

.Definition
****
*Economic operator* means any natural or legal person or public entity or group of such persons and/or entities, including any temporary association of undertakings, which offers the execution of works and/or a work, the supply of products or the provision of services on the market
****


The ESPDResponse was explicitly designed to hold data about one single Economic Operator.
Thus, the ESPDResponse Exchange Data Model associates a class `EconomicOperatorParty` as
a placeholder for the data related to only one Economic Operator (EO) that
tenders solely to a procurement project, to one of the EOs that tender as part of a group
(e.g. a Consortium), or to one possible sub-contractor of the EO.

Consortia grouping more than one EO need to draft and submit as many ESPDResponses as Economic
Operators and sub-contractors participate in the tender.
