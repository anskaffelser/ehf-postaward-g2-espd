== Requirement group

A requirement group is a group of requirements with a specific structure relating to one Criterion

NOTE: A requirement group MAY contain sub-groups of criteria. This nested structure allows the ESPD to represent
complex decision structures and capture faithfully the data represented in highly structured user interfaces
