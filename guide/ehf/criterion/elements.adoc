= Criteria elements

The tables below list and describe each class of the Core Criterion Vocabulary used in the ESPDRequest XML document.

Remember that the prefixes (ccv:, cbc: cac:, etc.) are representatives of the namespaces used in the
XSD Schema. See details in <<Schemas used>>

NOTE: The ESPDResponse copies the ESPDRequest and extends it with the Response of the EO.
