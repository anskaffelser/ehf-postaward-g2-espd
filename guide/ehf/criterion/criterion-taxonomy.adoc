= Criterion structure and the taxonomy

This EHF ESPD is based on the ESDP datamodel from the EU commission, and its method of structuring the criterions.
Each criterion has a defined set of requirement groups and requirements, all documented by the EU Commission in the {link-taxonomy}.

Please note that requirement groups can be nested within other requirement groups.

The following "rules" has been established on how to build up a data structure:

== Taxonomy

Respect the structure for each criterion in the {link-taxonomy}

== Indicator

The first requirement of a requirement group is reserved to ask a question where the response is an *INDICATOR* (boolean true or false).

.Example of indicator in first requirement
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::../shared/files/snippet2-response.xml[tags=indicator]
----
<1> First requirement of the group has expected response type INDICATOR


== Use of attribute `pi`

The attribute `pi` of the requirement group element is used to determine if the requirements and nested requirement groups must be answered expicitly or not.

The attribute has the following possible values:

GROUP_FULFILLED.ON_TRUE:: If the INDICATOR is set to true, the group and nested sub-groups must be answered. This is the case for all the exclusion criteria.

GROUP_FULFILLED.ON_FALSE:: If the INDICATOR is set to false, the group and nested sub-groups must be answered. Valid for some of the selection criteria.

include::../shared/files/snippet2-response.xml[tags=pi]
----
<1> `ccv:RequirementGroup/@pi` set to GROUP_FULFILLED.ON_TRUE
<2> The indicator is set to *false*, so explicit answer to this group must not be sent

=== Attribute `pi` not used

If the attribute `pi` is not used, the requirement group must be answered

----
<1> `ccv:RequirementGroup/@pi` not present
